< data type >
surname is a pick list (length is limited)
middlename is a edit box
firstname is a edit box
memo is for convenience

< flow >
memo always gets udpated
(1) surname -> middlename -> firstname
middlename -> surname -> (1)
surname -> middlename
surname -> firstname 
firstname -> middlename
middlename -> firstname
every action will update memo
surname will update middlename and firstname
middlename and firstname will update each other

< functionality >
main ---
save to file ¦n¦W¦r.txt
upgrade software (version track)
sync dictionary (version track) - XlsToCsv.vbs
log - date time of run record
watchdog - refreshing caption

<API>
int append_single(char word, int stroke);
assign_XML(...);
assign_JSON(...);
assign_CSV(...);  /* check existence and validation */
TStringList *getWordByStroke(int stroke);
void AI(int surname_strokes, int firstname_strokes);  /* yes or no */

< issue >
BCB 6.0 does not support unicode
cannot read utf8 file
surname must allow two words

< note >
combobox box is not length-limited, DropDownCount.
TStringList.Find(AnsiString) but not in TList class.

< source >
